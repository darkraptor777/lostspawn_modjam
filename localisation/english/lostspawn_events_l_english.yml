 lostspawn.2.name:0 "Seeking Answers"
 lostspawn.2.desc:0 "Aeons ago our creator left us at the mercy of the stars, never to return. After having felt their prescence for millenia, we were abandoned. Now, with the galaxy within our grasp, a hunger for answers to ancient questions burns inside us."

 lostspawn.101.name:0 "No Stone Unturned"
 lostspawn.101.desc:0 "There are myths and legends across many of our cultures that speak of a giant sphere that shaped our world and held vigil over us as we dreamed. Historical records detail a shared sense of isolation and uncertainty across nations when we awoke, alone. A dark age of conflict and strife followed, which inspired many of the tales which keep young [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnName] up at night."

 lostspawn.102.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] believes they have uncovered a central piece of the puzzle. There are traces of an enormous amount of energy that have been imbued into the very ground beneath us. [Root.GetLeaderName] theorises that this residual energy, which is not present elsewhere in our system, is a remenant left behind by our creator and that they may have left similar marks elsewhere in the galaxy."

 lostspawn.111.name:0 "Sister Remains" 
 lostspawn.111.desc:0 "Although heavily corroded and worn away, sparse ruins dot the landscapes of [From.GetName]. What little historical evidence remains talks of a great orb that shifted the very ground and gave rise to their civilisation. Members of the crew have also made remarks about how much of the remaining architecture bares an eerie resembalence to our own, with many of the same hallmarks."
 lostspawn.111.desc.old:0 "placeholder"
 lostspawn.112.name:0 "Weakening Source"
 lostspawn.112.desc:0 "After extensive study of the stone and landscape [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that the energy left behind here is recent than that of our homeworld, and yet has decayed much faster.

 lostspawn.113.name:0 "Twisted Failure"

 lostspawn.121.name:0 "Faint Signatures"
 lostspawn.121.desc:0 "Surveying efforts have been significantly hindered by the extreme conditions on [From.GetName]. In place the very tectonic plates themselves have been ripped asunder, exposing the viscous magma beneath. The crew has assembled a forward base to aid in surveying the planet."

 lostspawn.124.name:0 "Molten Mistake"
 lostspawn.124.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered a pattern in the extent of decay in the residual energy in relation to the distance from the previous system. Using this pattern they have concluded that a previously uncharted nearby system is the best bet for further clues. However our sensors are failing to detect any traces of the energy we have been following so far."
